							<b>Every year in the UK,</b> millions of pounds are spent by councils on collecting and disposing of residential waste. As the push to reduce waste and be more environmentally friendly increases, we will start to see a reduction in waste being sent to landfill. Conversely, we will see an increase in the amount of household waste to be recycled. If the regularity of waste collection could be reduced then significant savings could be made by councils.

							This project aimed to design and build a product that was able to reduce the volume of waste in consumers’ bins. As well as this, by creating a device which focuses specifically on recyclable material, the project set out to encourage consumers to take a more active role in recycling, ensuring the correct items end up in the correct bins. This would help to reduce the burden on councils and waste facilities in sorting and separating peoples waste.

							<div>Research</div>
							<p>Initial market research was conducted in the form of questionnaires to assess typical consumption and recycling habits. Contact was also made with a local Veolia recycling facility which allowed us to visit their facilities to interview their manager and tour the facility for a half day. Strength testing was also carried out in the laboratory on cans, tins, glass bottles and plastic bottles to understand potential requirements of the machine.</p>

						<li class="prosthetic">

							<div>Environment</div>
							<p>Many budget range solutions exist for crushing cans and bottles. In order to differentiate from what was available, the aim was to produce a solution which was able to deal with all recyclables. The likely higher cost was suited to 2 key target markets: high end residential and commercial. In the first scenario the machine would be in a kitchen, in the second the machine could be shared communally by a block of flats. Household bins are normally kept in the kitchen. There is a design trend to incorporate appliances within cabinets and self-contained units to create a less cluttered environment. Standard sizes of units were researched to help give an idea of potential size. </p>

							<div>Ideation</div>
							<p>As this was a group project, ideation was mainly conducted in the manner of discussion. Quick sketches were used to assist explanation of ideas to one another. Initial ideas focused primarily on manually operated designs however after further consideration it was decided upon using an automated system – giving greater flexibility and higher potential force. Many options were discussed, including an air compressor for plastic bottles, interlocking worm gears to crush glass, loading hopper for multiple items, integrated crushing and wrapping of recycling into cubes – negating separate bin bags.</p>

							<div>Functionality</div>
							<p>Although the aim was to design a solution which could reduce the volume of all recycling, after conducting research glass was found to be a large obstacle. Although it would be possible to break and crush glass, the resulting pieces could be both a nuisance: cutting through bin bags, and a hazard: grazing or cutting consumers. Heating methods were explored to help melt the glass and soften edges but this proved impractical. For this reason we decided to exclude glass from our target waste materials.</p>

							In order to finalise elements of the design, calculations needed to be carried out to ensure the machine would function correctly. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Key calculations determined the required torque and power rating of motor, bearing forces, gear design, lead screw sizes. A trade-off between operating speed, cost and size needed to be considered for each component.

							Before manufacturing, I created detailed engineering drawings. This was essential for all parts which were manufactured externally - due to complexity of design. The rest of the components I manufactured in house but it was still useful to operate off technical drawings.

						<p>1 - Bearing housings were designed in house but manufactured externally due to complexity. They involved a back ring to hold the bearings in place but still allow for the lead screw to pass through.</p>
						<p>2 - Opening for crushed items to drop into bin below</p>
						<p>3 - 16mm diameter leadscrew with 4mm pitch was used with threads removed at each end.</p>
						<p>4 - Deep groove ball bearings were used from industry leading SKF</p>
						<p>5 - Geared motor allowed for 1:1 gear ratio to be used. Plastic (hostaform) gears were externally sourced to drive the lead screws. The driving gear was manufactured in house out of aluminium to meet necessary strength requirements and to increase lifespan.</p>
						<p>6 - DC Geared Motor, Brushed, 24V dc, 66rpm, 25W   </p>
						<p>7 - Bronze lead screw nuts</p>
						<p>8 - Electronics were housed separately for prototype but would be incorporated into final design. </p>
